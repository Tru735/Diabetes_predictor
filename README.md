<h1> Diabetes Predictor</h1>
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical attributes. This project serves as my first hands-on machine learning application, using a dataset of health indicators to classify diabetes presence.

<br>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This diabetes predictor project aims to:

•Analyze medical data for patterns related to diabetes.<br>
•Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.<br>
•Evaluate model accuracy and improve through parameter tuning<br>
<br>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project includes various health indicators such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, etc. <br>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
•Python 3.x<br>
•NumPy<br>
•Pandas<br>
•Scikit-Learn<br>

<h2>Results</h2>
The current model achieves an accuracy of 80%.<br> Further improvements can be made through hyperparameter tuning and additional data.

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
Implement other machine learning algorithms for comparison.<br>
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Django.<br>
Integrate feature importance for better interpretability.
